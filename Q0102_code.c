//Write a Program to take a sorted array arr[] and an integer x as input, find the index (0-based) of the smallest element in arr[] that is greater than or equal to x and print it. This element is called the ceil of x. If such an element does not exist, print -1. Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the first occurrence.

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int n, i, x, ceilIndex = -1;

    printf("Enter the number of elements in the sorted array: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    int arr[n];

    printf("Enter %d sorted elements:\n", n);
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
    }

    printf("Enter the integer x to find its ceil: ");
    scanf("%d", &x);

    
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        if (arr[i] >= x)
        {
            ceilIndex = i;
            break; 
        }
    }

    printf("The index of the ceil of %d is: %d\n", x, ceilIndex);

    return 0;
